## Configuration

### Using UI

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=neakasa)

From the Home Assistant front page go to `Configuration` and then select `Devices & Services` from the list.
Use the `Add Integration` button in the bottom right to add a new integration called `Neakasa`.

## Troubleshooting Tips / Known Issues

1. When you discover  that the mobile app is starting over and over, beginning again with the login steps, then you should use this HA integration with a different account than with the app. Create a second account and use the share function in the app - simply share the device with the second account
2. powercycle the litterbox
3. reset the litterbox and reintegrate it
4. open an issue
